# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space serves as a showcase of both my personal and professional Python projects, demonstrating my experience in data analysis, scientific computing, automation, and more.

## About Me
I am Ethan D. Robinson, an Applied Physics graduate from Brigham Young University with a passion for problem-solving and software development. My background includes research in quantum information and materials science, as well as experience analyzing experimental data from the TRIUMF facility. I have worked extensively with Python and C++, applying these skills to real-world challenges in scientific computing and engineering.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. **Materials Science and MuSR Data**
- **Muon-Spin Relaxation Analysis** – Scripts used to analyze experimental data from TRIUMF, involving numerical solutions to quantum equations.
- **Statistical Data Processing** – Examples of statistical modeling and data visualization using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

### 2. **Scientific Analysis and Computational Physics**
- **Data Analysis and Step Forward Programing** – Simple programs designed to solve physical systems created during my studies at BYU.
- **Quality of Life Improvents** - Programs made to simplify and solve physical problems.
  
### 3. **Software & Game Development**
- **D&D Character Manager** – A JSON and SQLite3-based system for managing character data across multiple scripts. Primarily used as a testbed to help with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and applications.
- **Small-Scale Python Applications** – Various utility programs showcasing object-oriented programming and modular code design.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python (Primary), C++ (for certain projects)
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, SQLite3, TensorFlow (basic), Flask (basic)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, Git
